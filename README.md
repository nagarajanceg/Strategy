"I have done this assignment completely on my own. I have not copied
 it, nor have I given my solution to anyone else. I understand that if
 I am involved in plagiarism or cheating I will have to sign an
 official form that I have cheated and that this form will be stored in
 my official university record. I also understand that I will receive a
 grade of 0 for the involved assignment for my first offense and that I
 will receive a grade of F for the course for any additional
 offense."
